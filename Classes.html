    <H2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</H2>
    <p>â€œPrepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat
        with your arms at your side with palms up. Close your eyes
        and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let
        your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll on your side
        and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position with
        crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be
        grateful for all that you have in life. Namaste.</p>
